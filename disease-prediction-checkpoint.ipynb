      "description: Allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction of the immune system to substances that are normally harmless, known as allergens. Allergens can include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, certain foods, insect stings, medications, and latex, among others. When exposed to allergens, the immune system produces antibodies that trigger the release of histamine and other chemicals, leading to allergic symptoms.\n",
      "diet: In the case of food allergies, strict avoidance of the allergen is necessary. Otherwise, maintaining a healthy and balanced diet can support overall health and potentially help manage allergic reactions.\n",
      "Symptom: Symptoms of allergies vary depending on the type of allergen and the individuals sensitivity but may include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy or watery eyes, itching of the skin, hives, rash, swelling (angioedema), coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and anaphylaxis (a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction.\n",
      "Treatment: Treatment for allergies involves avoiding exposure to known allergens whenever possible and managing symptoms with medications. This may include antihistamines to reduce itching, sneezing, and runny nose; decongestants to relieve nasal congestion; nasal corticosteroids to reduce inflammation in the nasal passages; eye drops for allergic conjunctivitis; bronchodilators for allergic asthma; and epinephrine for severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). Allergy immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual immunotherapy) may also be recommended for individuals with severe allergies.\n",
      "Precaution: Precautions to prevent allergic reactions include identifying and avoiding known allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, certain foods, and insect stings, using allergen-proof bedding covers, regularly cleaning and vacuuming the home, keeping pets out of the bedroom, wearing protective clothing and gear when outdoors, carrying medications such as antihistamines or epinephrine for emergency use, and seeking medical advice if allergic symptoms are severe or persist despite treatment. Additionally, individuals with severe allergies should consider wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace and informing family members, friends, and caregivers about their allergies and emergency action plan.\n"
